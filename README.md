#INHERITANCE AND POLYMORPHISM
**Info on the assignment:**

   In this assignment we will create a 2D predator-prey simulation. In this simulation, the prey are ants, and the predators are bugs. These critters live in a world composed of a 20Ã—20 grid of cells. Only one critter may occupy a cell at a time. The grid is enclosed, so a critter is not allowed to move off the edges of the grid. Time is simulated in discrete steps. Each critter performs some action every time step. The behaviour of the world and the critters is further described in the following chapters.
